# Arduino Thermometer

## Project Status: Breadboard Prototype
I have moved the design from Tinkercad to a physical Arduino Uno on a breadboard.

### Current Progress
* Assembled the circuit on a breadboard.
* **Fixed:** The display was flickering because the update loop was too fast. I added a 5-second timer to the code to stabilize the readout.
