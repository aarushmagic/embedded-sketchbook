# Arduino Thermometer

## Project Status: Assembly & Soldering
I have transferred the circuit from the breadboard to a permanent soldered solution.

### Current Progress
* **Hardware:** Soldered all components onto a perfboard (modified/cut to size).
* **Integration:** Positioned the TMP37 sensor and 7-segment displays to align with the planned enclosure openings.
* **Testing:** Initial continuity checks pass, but I need to verify temperature accuracy on the new power rail.
